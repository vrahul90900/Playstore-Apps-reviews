# Playstore-Apps-reviews
1.	PROBLEM STATEMENT
Google play store data contains information about different category of apps in multiple rows and columns. The data analysis approaches have been adopted in order to eliminates certain bottlenecks. The objective of this project involves exploratory data analysis using multiple libraries of python for data visualization to draw preliminary conclusions. Thus, it has been elucidated from data analysis using python helps in determination of target apps for their successful launch. 
2.	INTRODUCTION
Technological advancement in the field of portable applications (Mobile Apps) have turned out to be need of our daily lives. Sometime it is very difficult for us to understand everything about the apps as new applications are getting launched in market each and every day. There are number of Apps that have already introduced in the market along with their applications that are available in the Google Play App Store. 
A variety of Apps based on different categories are available on the play store either free or paid that can be downloaded by a single click. There are lots of Apps which are offered by trusted developers and also some from new developers. It is basically depending on user interest to go for an individual app. Additionally, developers, software and application engineers are trying to understand and making it more ease for a user and trying to remove huddles on the performance of an App. Usually, a developer or an application creator create an app and drop it on play store but the main thing is that whether the user is happy with the application or not. For this play store has a rate and review system for each app A user can rate an App according to his satisfaction. This process is quite complicated. We have to make it more ease for the user. 
In this project work, sorting, cleaning and arranging unstructured data into structured form have been adopted for better understanding. Furthermore, various steps have been followed in order to make sorted data in a readable format, building relationships based on information given in various data sets. Multiple function has been developed for extracting data in a sorter time period. In future, it helps in determining for ideal speculation of  in order to clarify for better demonstrations. 
3.	GOOGLE PLAY STORE AND USER REVIEW 
The current world is known for its technological advancement and its applications plays an essential role in our daily life. The mobile apps have made our life simpler and fast. The mobile apps offer a wide range of services through its applications designed for the purpose of providing education, efficient food delivery, ease in transportation ticket booking and such more. Lots of application have been created slots of portable application has been designed and created has have created a huge income for the developers and application industry. Such apps connect consumers to various service providers and vice-versa. I think it should be
As everyone now a days has been making some kind of application and uploading them on play store it is very important for a developer to work on a right path. To make profit and high income an application engineer or a developer should work on a correct way. The google play store consists a billion of Apps and is much bigger than apple store.  I have gathered some information on google play store. 
4.	GOOGLE PLAYSTORE DATASET

Google play store information and data set has been taken from Alma better which is a very popular and large platform to analyse, examine and review data. Information of more than 10k application has been taken. This data set can be used to examine the Android market of different use of genre and category like game, music, health, family etc. by the help of this a user can read and analyse whether the app will get a good rating or not. This dataset can be moreover used for future references for the proposal of any application. The unwanted or spam data can be removed by this. With the help of this dataset, we will examine various factors like rating, free or paid and other things. 

The data set contains the following columns:
1.	App
2.	Category
3.	Rating
4.	Reviews
5.	Size 
6.	Installs
7.	Type
8.	Price
9.	Content Rating
10.	Genre
11.	Last updated
12.	Current version
13.       Android version

5.	PYHTON 
Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world in recent years. It can used in multiple domains from machine learning to building websites and software testing. It can be used by developers and non-developers alike. Python is a general-purpose language, which means it’s designed to be used in a range of applications, including data science, software and web development, automation, and generally getting stuff done. Pandas are a python library. pandas are used to analyse data. we have created lots of bars and plots with these.
5.1. DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.
Bad data could be:
•	Empty cells
•	Data in wrong format
•	Wrong data
•	Duplicates

Step 1. Importing Libraries
Let’s get Pandas and NumPy up and running on your Python script. 
Step2: 2. Input Customer Feedback Dataset
Next, we ask our libraries to read a feedback dataset.  
Step 3: 3. Locate Missing Data
Next, we are going to use a secret Python hack known as ‘isnull function’ to discover our data. Actually, a common function, 'isnull' helps us find where in our dataset there are missing values. This is useful information as this is what we need to correct while data cleaning. 
Step 4: 4. Detect Outliers
Outliers are numerical values that lie significantly outside of the statistical norm. Cutting that down from unnecessary science garble – they are data points that are so out of range they are likely misreads.  They, like duplicates, need to be removed. Let’s sniff out an outlier by first, pulling up our dataset.
